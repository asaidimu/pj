# Problem Solving

This section provides guidance on diagnosing and resolving common issues encountered while using PJ.

### General Troubleshooting Steps
1.  **Check Dependencies**: Ensure all [required dependencies](#dependencies) are installed and accessible in your `PATH`.
2.  **Verify Paths**: Double-check `PROJECTS_PATH` in `~/.config/pj/env.sh` and ensure project directories exist at expected locations.
3.  **Check Permissions**: Custom plugins, recipes, and the `pj` executable itself must have execute permissions (`chmod +x`).
4.  **Review Logs**: PJ generates detailed logs at `/tmp/$USER/pj/$(date +"%d_%m").log`. These logs often contain error messages or warnings that can pinpoint the issue.
5.  **Run with `DEBUG=1`**: Temporarily set `export DEBUG=1` in your shell before running a `pj` command to enable verbose debug output. This can reveal internal execution flow and variable states.

### Error Reference
PJ uses specific error codes for different failure conditions. Refer to the [Errors](#errors) section in the full reference for details on specific error types and their resolutions.

#### Common Issues & Solutions
*   **Command not found**: If `pj` command itself is not found, ensure `~/.local/bin` is in your shell's `PATH` environment variable. If it's not, you may need to add `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or equivalent startup file.
*   **Project not found for `archive` or `delete`**: Ensure the project name you are providing exactly matches a directory name under your `PROJECTS_PATH`.
*   **`tmux` session not created**: Check if `tmux` is installed and running correctly. Also, verify if the project's `.pj` or `.project` script is interfering with session creation.
*   **Custom plugin/recipe not working**: Ensure the script file has `#!/bin/sh` as the first line, is executable (`chmod +x`), and is placed in the correct `~/.config/pj/plugins/` or `~/.config/pj/plugins/recipes/` directory.
*   **Update failed (`pj update`)**: Verify internet connectivity and ensure `curl` and `jq` are installed and working. Sometimes, a full reinstall (`sh <(curl...)`) might be necessary if the update mechanism itself is corrupted.

If you're still facing issues, consider reporting them on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/asaidimu/pj/issues) with detailed reproduction steps and log output.
